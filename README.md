## What is the app about?

It's a light price monitoring web-based application that displays Nintendo Switch games, which are currently on sale. 

To extract games and pricing information use [nintendo-switch-eshop library](https://lmmfranco.github.io/nintendo-switch-eshop/index.html)

Refer to the mockup for layout and basic functionality.
